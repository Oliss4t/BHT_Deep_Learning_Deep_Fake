"# BHT_Deep_Learning_Deep_Fake" 

I created this project during our "Deep Learning" lecture at the BHT Data Science Master program.
My goal was to get an understanding of how deep fakes are made. 
Therefore, I created an convolutional based autoencoder for a simple face-swap.
Additionally I looked into how the open soure framework "Deep Fake Lab" works and what different steps it uses to create realistic deep fakes.
Further information is in the powerpoint presentation.
Becaus of privacy reasons i have not uploaded my picture folder.
